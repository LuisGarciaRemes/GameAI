# GameAI
 
Assignment 1.

All the behaviours were implemented as static methods in the file MovementAlgorithms.h/cpp in the folder \of_v0.11.0_vs2017_release\apps\myApps\GameAIAssignments in the repo.

Its seemed like the openframeworks project generator requires the solution to be in the myApps folder..

When the solution runs it will first display the basic motion behavior.

You can press the left arrow key to restart the current simulation.

You can press the right arrow key to move to the next simulation.

The current simulation title is displayed in the window bar.
